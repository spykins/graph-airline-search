# Guestlogix Take Home Test - Backend

At Guestlogix we feel that putting developers on the spot with advanced algorithmic puzzles doesn't exactly highlight one's true skillset. The intention of this assessment is to see how you approach and tackle a problem in the real world, not quivering in front of a whiteboard.

### What is the test?

You will be building an endpoint that allows users to search a data set. Included in this repository is a set of Airport, Airline, and Route data. Your task is to create models to represent, relate and ultimately expose the data to a GET endpoint. Users of the API will be able to search for airlines that service a specified route.

### User Stories (Requirements)

- As a user I can make a GET request to an endpoint with an `origin` and `destination` query parameter, and reveive back all the airlines (if any) that offer flights between them.
- As a user I am provided meaningful feedback should no Airlines offer flights between the airports.

### Getting Started

For this test you can use any technology you want... seriously. Node.js? Do it. .NET? Send it. PHP? That still exists? Basically, the point is, use whatever you want, really, no need to try and impress us with a new tech if you aren't familiar with it, use what you like, anyone can learn a new framework. The only downside is because we want to leave this up to you, we can't really boilerplate the build steps and such for you, so that adds a little bit of time for you... sorry.

### Submitting

1. Fork this repository and provide your solution.
2. Run through it one last time to make sure it works!
3. Edit SUBMISSION.md to include instructions on how to run the application
